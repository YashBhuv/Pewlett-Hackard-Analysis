# Pewlett Hackard Employees Database Management and Analysis
## Project Overview
In this project, Database analysis for the employees eligible for the retirement has been carried out. The retirement criterion was that the birth date of the employee should be between 1952 and 1955. And also the employee should be hired between 1985 and 1988.

Tools
SQL, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin

##Results
Number of individuals retiring: There are 33118 current employees which are retiring as per the above criterion.

Number of individuals being hired: The number of individuals being hired should be ideally equal to the number of retirees (i.e.33118). But there should also be some criterion for hiring as well.

Number of individuals available for mentorship role: There are 1549 employees who are eligible for mentorship role.The mentorship criterion was that the employee should be born in year 1965.

##Summary
Recommendation for further analysis on this data set: There should be some criterion for hiring individuals as well. Because with the change of time and the technology enhancement or automation the company requirement changes. Also the current salary should be updated in the database after the employees's promotion.
